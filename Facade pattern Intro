Simple interfaces to complex subsystems abound in real life. They can be created to make frequent use of a system faster, or to differentiate between novices and power users.
\A good illustration is Amazon.com’s 1-Click® system, which simplifies the process of ordering items for well-known customers
. Normally, after selecting an item to purchase, an Amazon customer has to enter delivery and bank account details before the order is accepted.
If these details are stored and the customer verifies her identity in some way, 1-Click takes that customer straight to the checkout. 
The customer’s stored bank account details and selected delivery address are used for the purchase, thus considerably speeding up (and simplifying) the ordering process.
Thus, the 1-Click option forms a façade to the fuller system underneath.
